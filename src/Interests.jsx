            <p>My interests lie in a range of technology-related fields, including coding, web development, 
                and machine learning. I enjoy problem-solving through programming, particularly using languages like C++ and 
                Python to develop efficient algorithms. Web development excites me because it allows me to build dynamic,
                 user-friendly interfaces and interactive websites.</p>
